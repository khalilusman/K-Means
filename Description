KMeans clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into distinct clusters. It iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids based on the current cluster assignments. The process repeats until the centroids stabilize, helping to group similar data points together based on their features
